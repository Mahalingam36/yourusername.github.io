    <h1>About the Project ðŸŒ </h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Space Biology Knowledge Engine</strong> is designed to explore 
      how life adapts beyond Earth. Our goal is to collect and visualize biological 
      data from space missions to understand how microgravity affects plants, 
      humans, and microorganisms.

    <h1>Our Mission ðŸš€</h1>
    <p>
      To build a bridge between biology and space science by creating a 
      simple, interactive platform that helps researchers and students 
      learn how living systems behave in microgravity.
